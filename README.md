TO PLAY:

The current version of the game runs only in python. So if have Python2
installed you can run it by cloning this repository and then finding this
directory in your favorite terminal and running

python riddle_game.py

in the terminal. It will give you two options, New and Load. Just choose a New
game by typing

new

If you want to load a previously saved game typing load will instantly do that
for you.

ABOUT:

This is a text-based game where you have to solve some riddles.

There's a really pretty door, see if you can get the stones to walk through it.

This game involves metaphorical cheese and wishy-washy pretentious advice...
I hope you enjoy :)

Type 'help' into the game if you are confused about what to do.

*A note on saving the game. When you run this action, it creates/overrides the
file saved.py the same folder as riddle_game.py, so there is only one available
save slot. If there is no saved game currently logged, load will just start a
new game.

**If you find some kind of bug that makes the game less enjoyable you can save
the game and contact me at Andrei.Borissenko@gmail.com. Most fixes would be
compatible with older saved versions of the game. Though I have tested this game
enough that I hope you won't have to deal with anything truly annoying. Cheers!
