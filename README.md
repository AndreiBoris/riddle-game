# riddle-game
This is a text-based game where you have to solve some riddles.

There's a really pretty door, see if you can get the stones to walk through it.

This game involves metaphorical cheese and wishy-washy pretentious advice...
I hope you enjoy :)

Type 'help' into the game if you are confused about what to do.

*A note on saving the game. When you run this function, it creates/overrides the
file saved.py the clone folder, so there is only one available save slot. If
there is no saved game currently logged, load will just start a new game.
