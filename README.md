# riddle-game
This is a text-based game where you have to solve some riddles.

There's a really pretty door, see if you can get the stones to walk through it.

This game involves metaphorical cheese and wishy-washy pretentious advice...
I hope you enjoy :)

Type 'help' into the game if you are confused about what to do.

*A note on saving the game. When you run this action, it creates/overrides the
file saved.py the same folder as riddle_game.py, so there is only one available
save slot. If there is no saved game currently logged, load will just start a
new game.

**If you find some kind of bug that makes the game less enjoyable you can save
the game and contact me at Andrei.Borissenko@gmail.com. Most fixes would be
compatible with older saved versions of the game. Though I have test this game
enough that I hope you won't have to deal with anything truly annoying. Cheers!
