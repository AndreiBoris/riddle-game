## TO PLAY:

Using Git

Type in the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/AndreiCommunication/riddle-game.git
cd riddle-game
python riddle-game.py
```

If you're not familar with Git or Python, you should be able to run it by 
downloading the zip file. Extracting it. Making sure you have Python 2.7.something 
installed (from Python website) and then right clicking on riddle_game.py and 
running it with Python.


## ABOUT:

This is a text-based game where you have to solve some riddles.

There's a really pretty door, see if you can get the stones to walk through it.

This game involves metaphorical cheese and wishy-washy pretentious advice...
I hope you enjoy :)

Type 'help' into the game if you are confused about what to do.

*A note on saving the game. When you run this action, it creates/overrides the
file saved.py the same folder as riddle_game.py, so there is only one available
save slot. If there is no saved game currently logged, load will just start a
new game.

**If you find some kind of bug that makes the game less enjoyable you can save
the game and contact me at Andrei.Borissenko@gmail.com. Most fixes would be
compatible with older saved versions of the game. Though I have tested this game
enough that I hope you won't have to deal with anything truly annoying. Cheers!

A thank you goes out to Arash Moghimi and Bryan Weiser for providing some
suggestions for improvement!
